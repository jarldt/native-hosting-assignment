## Additional Features, Improvements, and Ideas

Additional improvements and ideas for this assignment that I would have liked to explore or implement if given more time.

- Protect critical endpoints by requiring credentials.
- Logging of site deletion events.
- Offer a temporary, tokenized URL for users to preview their site before public release.
- Abstract file I/O into its own service
- Validate site name from path in DeploymentLogsHandler

## Developer Commentary

This assignment was reminiscent of some of the custom automation tools that I've created over the years as a consultant -- especially unzipping and staging files from a ZIP archive. This feature has been necessary in many of the tools I've created in the past. I had fun working on this assignment and I hope it reflects my passion for software development as you review it. Even though I've been programming for more than 20 years, it's still exciting and feels like a small miracle every time a project starts to come together and everything works as envisioned at the start. This excitement is what has kept me programming throughout the years -- even on hobby projects on nights and weekends. Thank you for reviewing my submission.
